RocketGPT is a work-in-progress (WIP) application that demonstrates the power of AI-powered applications and prompt engineering. Built using the Rocket.Chat platform, this project aims to showcase how conversational AI models like OpenAI's GPT can be integrated into a chat-based application to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.

## How it works

RocketGPT leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT model to process and generate human-like responses to user inputs. By incorporating prompt engineering techniques, RocketGPT can craft context-aware and coherent responses that facilitate engaging and informative conversations.

## Installation

To get started with RocketGPT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rocketgpt.git
cd rocketgpt
```

2. Set up Rocket.Chat and MongoDB using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


3. Initialize the MongoDB replica set:

```bash
docker-compose exec mongo mongo --eval "rs.initiate({_id: 'rs01', members: [{_id: 0, host: 'mongo:27017'}]})"
```


4. Access the Rocket.Chat interface at `http://localhost:3000` and create an account.

5. Configure the OpenAI GPT integration by providing your API key and other necessary settings.

6. Start a conversation with the RocketGPT bot and enjoy AI-powered responses.
